(Oh, Hicks made this shit)

You know, every answer that's a question
I done beat the odds twice, so you know I'm countin' my blessings
Watch my vision clear, I see my opps anywhere
I done broke up with my dawg, got a divorce with my fear
Fell in love with my dream, tried to plant a couple seeds
I can rock with the title, just don't ask me for a ring
Can't believe Instagram, it's smoke and mirrors
Everything ain't what it seem to be, in fact and clearer
I, I've been goin' through a couple things now
Bitches lyin' on my name, tryna gain clout
Like, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
You gon' get throu-ou-ou-ough
I had my mind in set to go and get a milly
'Til slime told me, "Bro, where the fuck a milly"
Bitches screamin' at my shows, look I done did it
Got a cool ass man, but tryna ball like she did it
Red bottom spike, bitch, I'm lit
I'm a broke big dream, you can say I'm it
I had to cut my mans out, he did it for himself
They told me, "Foonk go right, this fool went left"
Let another nigga try to play me, out of pocket
I'm itchin' to prove a point to show these fools I still got it
(Brrt, brrt) Got a call that your man here
And fuck the DA, next month then I'm out of here

Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Everything ain't what it seems to be
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors

These niggas hopin' that I don't succeed
I kick more shit than David Beckham
Ride around with a felon, gotta be careful
Couldn't take some people with me, so I had left 'em
Jumpin' on the stage showin' out, I'm in Tampa, uh
If you cross me, you a dub
I'm takin' advantage of this fuckin' buzz
I'm from the hood, you know where they was
I got sixty blue strips like I knew cuz
Yeah, smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
I got twenty thousand stuffed, these Amiri
You can tell the hater that I'm here
Got the hottest mixtape [?]
Took two-fifty on the bond bail
Slimed him out for a brick, then I told him that his [?]
I'm done talkin' 'bout the appeal
Mom Duke said, "Fuck 'em, nigga, tell them how you feel"
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Everything ain't what it seems to be
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
These niggas hopin' that I don't succeed

Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors
