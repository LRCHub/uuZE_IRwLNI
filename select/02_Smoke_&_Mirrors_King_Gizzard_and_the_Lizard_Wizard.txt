Smoke and mirrors steering clear of ya
Watch you tear up interior
Inferior actions, mysterious convoluted satisfaction
To see the suffering of others
Like you're above us, you're not among us
It's not a concern to see me squirm like a worm
In the beak of an eagle
It's evil
Step back, we must progress to our sequel

Smoke and mirrors disappearing when you're near us
Uncontactable, retractable
You must be held accountable for this

Timeland

Quit the chit-chatter, backstabber
Face up to the matter on a silver platter
Ducking and diving, you've been hiding
Undermining our capabilities
This operation is breaking, you're flaking
It's all unfolding at the seams

Another puppet to your strings
Another sucker with a broken wing (smoke and mirrors)
Another puppet to your strings
Another sucker with a broken wing (smoke and mirrors)
Another puppet to your strings
Another sucker with a broken wing (smoke and mirrors)
Another motherfucker trying to live the dream
